## Hi there 👋

# 🎯 My Project Collection

Welcome! This repo is basically a **hub** for all my projects.  
Think of it like the lobby of a game — you pick a door and jump into the world of that project.  

I’ve grouped things into four main collections:  
- 🤖 Discord Bots  
- 🌐 Websites  
- 📺 Streaming / Media  
- 🎨 Computer Graphics  

Each project link includes a short intro + main skills/tech I used.

## 📝 Notes
- This is my **personal project hub** — I keep it simple, but feel free to explore deeper in each repo.  
- Most projects started as side quests to learn something new 🚀  
- Tech stack varies, but overall you’ll see a mix of **JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, cloud tools, and graphics frameworks**.
